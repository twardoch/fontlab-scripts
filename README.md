## Installation

1. Download and unzip [twardoch-fontlab-scripts-master.zip](https://github.com/twardoch/twardoch-fontlab-scripts/archive/master.zip). Then:
2. With Finder or File Explorer, go inside the `Script` subfolder that is inside the unzipped folder.
3. In another Finder or File Explorer window, go to your FontLab 7 [user data folder](https://help.fontlab.com/fontlab/7/manual/Custom-data-files-and-locations/#user-data-folder). Unless you have picked a custom location in _Preferences > General > User data folder_, it’s:
   - on macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/FontLab/FontLab 7` where `~` is your home folder
   - on Windows: `%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Fontlab\Fontlab 7` where `%userprofile%` is your home folder
4. If there is no `Scripts` folder inside your user data folder, create it.
5. Copy the contents of the unzipped `Scripts` folder into the `Scripts` folder in your user data folder.
6. Run FontLab 7, or if it’s running, choose _Scripts > Refresh Scripts_

## Usage

Open a font and run the scripts from the _Scripts_ menu
